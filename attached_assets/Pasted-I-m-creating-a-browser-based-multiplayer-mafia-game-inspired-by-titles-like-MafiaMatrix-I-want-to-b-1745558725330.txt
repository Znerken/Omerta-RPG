I'm creating a browser-based multiplayer mafia game inspired by titles like MafiaMatrix. I want to build a clean and optimized MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first, using modern tools and modular architecture. Please help me set up the backend and frontend foundation, including the core systems listed below.

üß± Build This Core MVP Feature Set:
1. User System
Register/Login (username, password, email)

Session management (login persistence, logout)

Password hashing + validation

Simple admin panel for managing users

2. Player Profile Page
Show: username, level, XP, reputation, cash, inventory

Optional: avatar and bio

3. Crime System
Players perform crimes with varying difficulty

Crimes have success/fail chance based on player stats

Rewards: cash, XP

Include cooldowns (e.g. can only do one crime per minute)

Show recent crime history on profile

4. Stats & Progression
Stats: Strength, Stealth, Charisma, Intelligence

Level system (XP-based)

Stat training page with cooldowns

5. Jail System
Crimes can result in jail time (random chance)

Timer counts down real-time

Simple escape option (50/50 chance, cooldown)

Jail chat for inmates to interact

6. Gangs / Factions
Create/join gang

Gang name, tag, description, logo (optional for now)

Gang bank (shared funds)

Gang ranks: Leader, Officer, Member

Gang-only chatroom or message board

7. Inventory & Items
Items: weapons, tools, protection gear

Items can be equipped or consumed

Each item affects gameplay (e.g. +10% escape chance)

8. Messaging System
Player-to-player messages

Global chat, Gang chat, Jail chat

System notifications (crime success, jail, item received)

9. Cooldown System
Crime cooldown

Training cooldown

Escape attempt cooldown

Use cron jobs or background timers

10. Economy
In-game cash as core currency

Earn from crimes, spend on training, items, bribes

Gang bank deposit/withdraw

11. Leaderboards
Daily/weekly: Top players by XP, cash, crimes

Top gangs by earnings or rep

12. Bonus Feature (Optional if Easy):
Daily login reward claim system

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack Suggestions (Open to Better Ones):
Frontend: React or basic HTML/CSS (if simple), with state managed via Redux or React Context

Backend: Node.js with Express

Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (whichever integrates faster for relationships)

Auth: JWT or session-based (whichever is easiest to implement securely)

Hosting: Local dev now; deploy on Replit or Vercel later

üîÑ Other Requirements:
Modular architecture so new crimes, items, or missions can easily be added later

Secure all forms and endpoints (avoid exploits, SQL injection, XSS)

Comment code well so I can build on top of it

Use basic responsive design principles (mobile-friendly)

Once the MVP works, I‚Äôll add more advanced features like PvP, black market, real-time events, and undercover/snitch mechanics.
